# XC3-countdown

A simple countdown for checking when Xenoblade Chronicles 3 releases.
Shows the time that has passed since the announcement, the remaining waiting time and how much time has already passed in percent.
Requires Python, the modules datetime and turtle (they already come with Python) and the use of PC (does not work on mobile).

In case you want to use this countdown for other events, you can do so by changing the variables right at the beginning of the code.
